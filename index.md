# CTF Wiki 

Transplant from: http://ctf.forgottensec.com/wiki/index.php

This is the beginning of the construction of a wiki for information about various CTFs and InfoSec Competitions. I had it set for OPEN EDIT, but jerks from the Ukraine decided to deface my site a bunch times this week. Now you need an account to make edits. Feel free to use the information and/or register and contribute. My current focus is getting information about each competition, but as I have more time/help, I will be writing labs for each subject needed for these competitions. If you have any questions, feel free to email me at Forgotten {at} forgottensec {dot} com

The InfoSec field has a very strong community. Moving with those sentiments, I have decided to dedicate this wiki to organizing competition information for CTFs. These competitions help the skills of community to be passed along in a fun and enjoyable way. As many of us are love solving challenges, CTFs are a natural step to learn and improve. Getting started with CTFs can be daunting, I hope that the information within helps people to improve their skills and become a stronger part of the community. In turn, I hope as people improve, they come back and contribute to help others.
